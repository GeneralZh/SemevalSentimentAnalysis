@SkyNewsTonight George Osborne must be p***ing himself. Talk about unintended consequences. PMQs will be interesting on Wednesday
@TaxonomyCat It's clearly a trap. In fact suspect it may have been prentis who emailed out pretending to be George Osborne.
@julesmattsson I recently got oddly misty-eyed over that night George Osborne sat in the wrong carriage
