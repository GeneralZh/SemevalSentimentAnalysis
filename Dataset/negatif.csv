So Amazon Prime day got rained out right? Cause there's no way those deals rival Black Friday deals. When's the rain date?
So cynical of the electoral board to make preparations for snap polls on Nov. 1 as Pres. Erdogan refuses to give gov-forming mandate to CHP.
so Harper is blaming Del Mar racing another meet for the summer meet's struggle.  Never change California racing.
So it turns out Amazon Prime Day *did* turn out a lot like Black Friday--overhyped and not worth the time. #BitterOldManTweet
