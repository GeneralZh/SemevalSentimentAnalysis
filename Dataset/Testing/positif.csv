My last market for the year! Looking forward to the Richmond Good Food Twilight Market this Wednesday night... https://t.co/Z7IYaUGaNK
My life: I'm going out to lunch with Captain America* on Saturday. (Not Chris Evans. :p Cosplayers make life so much more fun.)
My mate in Turin has spare ticket for U2 gig tomorrow. I was going but we had a baby this wk! Any #F1 fans in #Monza want it DM me. #genuine
My memory tells me that Frank Gifford was the 1st  athlete I asked for an autograph. I was a youngster and he was a Giant. At a Yankee game
My middle daughter just told me a 5th grade presentation in her class was on Seth Rollins.  #school #wwe #education
"my mom and I may have many differences, but we will always agree when it comes to Ed Sheeran..  #EdSheeran #perfection"
My mom and I sat in the bathroom all night jamming nirvana and painting our nails &amp; just talking. Probably the best night I've had in awhile
My mom has Intel that Caitlyn Jenner goes to the Starbucks down the road every morning. My brother is pleading to go tomorrow. That's my day
My mom is really lecturing me about how Sharknado is such a good movie &amp; that everyone watches it which is why they came out with a 3rd one.
My mom is seeing Jason Aldean for the 10th time this weekend and she's met him already and has VIP and she isn't taking me
My mom is trying to make me cry by saying the Ed Sheeran concert next Thursday is going to rain out.
"my mom just came in to my room, sat down on my bed, and with a straight face said ""Tina, 24 days until we see Ed Sheeran.. what do I wear?!"""
"My mom just said, and I'm not kidding: Tomorrow is Star Wars day, are you ready to see all the treakies at the theater?"
"my mom still isnt sure if she can go to sam smith with me or not tomorrow, she needs to let me know so i can find someone else to go with"
my mom tomorrow: why are you so tired me: [flashbacks to watching chris evans interviews all night] me: uh
my monday has consisted of Paul McCartney on a loop in my head and craving honey barbecue boneless wings with ranch from bdubs
My Monday went pretty well and I am 100% convinced it's bc my Dunkin cashier gave me a large when I ordered a medium
My money is on John Cena.. And Brock Lesnar... Two of the best matches you'll get to see on Sunday!!!!!!!!!!!!
My movie @IAmThorMovie is going on tour starting this Tuesday. Screening followed by a THOR performance. https://t.co/TKUriliV4a
My pals are off to the lake to hear the Foo Fighters and I'm just sat out my room listening from the distance.  Bailed again.
My parents are going to the Zac Brown Band concert tomorrow night and I'm so jealous.
my parent's said i can go to milan on the 26th so I'M MEETING LENA IN LIKE 3 WEEKS I'M SO HAPPY
My phone corrected you to Thu so instead of "I believe in you" I said "I believe in Thursday."  Thor would be happy with this news.
My pictures are always like the 2nd one but he is Justin Bieber so he's perfect anyway. https://t.co/BDwAmYnkru
My plan for tomorrow's surprise day off is to finally see Ant-Man.
My plans were to Sharknado 1&amp;2 it up for tomorrow's big premiere... But OITNB won. 1/2way thru season 3.. I need more hrs in the day..

My Take coming up:  Frank Gifford's impact on the game and on me. Monday Night Football was never just a game. It's an event. @wkyc
My thoughts and prayers are with my @ProFootballHOF comrade Frank Gifford and his family.  May our #NFL great rest in paradise.
"My thoughts go out to the family of Frank Gifford, great on Monday Night Football and in The Hall of Fame in football. #RIPFrankGifford"
"My top 3 are probably: Granny Chiyo &amp; Sakura vs Sasori, Guy vs Kissame (the 2nd time) and Naruto vs Pain."
My turn to be office DJ - U2 on repeat. "One may come in the name of love.."
My tweets are so inconsistent.  I can go from "Mon Scotland" to "Nirvana are amazing" to "I love Doctor Who" in the space of 5 minutes.
My Twitter feed just blew up with the fact Paper Towns is out tomorrow
"My verdict on Paper Towns: solid 8/10. Very nice, simply done. May have fallen in love with Nat Wolff's acting more than humanly possible."
Nailed it! BOOYAH! Greatest MNF Memory Earl Campbell 199 yds 4 TD's and the 81 TD Run! I was 9! Frank Gifford RIP! https://t.co/RfRxiQB1wA
"Naruto is like crack. I keep saying saying one more episode, until ""Oh look, the sun."" #NARUTO"
